// 16 bits itself, from a table, instead of letting TFT_eSPI do it a pixel at
// a time. A table built from arithmetic that differs by one bit shifts every
// colour on the device slightly; nothing would crash and no screen would look
// obviously wrong, and the only way to notice would be two boards side by
// side. So all 256 of them are checked here rather than by eye.
//
// The reference is derived from what the bits MEAN -- red and green are three
// bits each expanded to five and six, blue is two expanded to five -- rather
// than copied from the same expression the code uses, because a test that
// repeats the code's own arithmetic only proves the file was saved.
